Episode 8 — Surgical Edits: `edit_file` + the Fuzzy Fallback Wrapper
====================================================================

The agent graduates from whole-file rewrites to SEARCH-REPLACE edits — the
format used by Aider, Codex, and Cline. We add a teaching wrapper,
`edit_file_safe(path, search, replace)`: exact match first, difflib fuzzy
match (>=90%) on a miss, unified diff on total failure so the model
self-corrects. Goes through the Ep 6 approval gate.

Builds on: Episodes 1-7.

Run:
    CODEIT_WORKDIR=./workspace python tutorial.py \
        "In big.py, change line 50 to say 'EDITED' instead of 'some content'. Use edit_file_safe."

Requires: pip install deepagents langchain-ollama rich.
