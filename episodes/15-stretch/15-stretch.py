Episode 15 — LangSmith Observability Appendix
=============================================

Show viewers how to see what the agent is DOING under the hood. With
LangSmith tracing on, every model call, tool call, subagent delegation,
and the full message history at each step becomes visible in a trace URL
you can open in the browser.

This is the LEAST new code of any episode — mostly docs + a tiny helper.
LangSmith is already a dep from Phase 0; no new install needed.

New pieces:
  1. `.env.example` entries: LANGSMITH_API_KEY=, LANGSMITH_TRACING=true,
     LANGSMITH_PROJECT=codeit-demo. (Set these in your .env.)
  2. `codeit/observability.py` — `trace_url_for_run(run_id)` and
     `maybe_print_trace_url(state)` helpers.
  3. The demo runs a task with tracing on and prints the trace URL at the end.

⚠️ Assumption: env var names are LANGSMITH_* (per the ecosystem-primer skill).
   Older names (LANGCHAIN_API_KEY, LANGCHAIN_TRACING) no longer work.
⚠️ The trace URL shape changes over time. The helper is best-effort; if the
   URL doesn't open, direct viewers to the LangSmith dashboard and have them
   find the run by project + timestamp.

Builds on: Episodes 1-14. Requires: pip install deepagents langchain-ollama rich langsmith.
Run:
    export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=...
    export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
    export LANGSMITH_PROJECT=codeit-demo
    CODEIT_WORKDIR=./examples/sample_app python tutorial.py "fix the failing test"

Requires: pip install deepagents langchain-ollama rich langsmith.
